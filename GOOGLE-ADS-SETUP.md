# Google Ads Setup Guide for rose.glass

## 🎯 Goal: $500 Revenue by January 15, 2025

**Math:** $500 ÷ $49 per sale = **~11 sales needed** (10.2 sales)

**Timeline:** 10 days remaining

**Strategy:** Drive PAID traffic immediately (SEO takes weeks/months to rank)

---

## Prerequisites (MUST complete first)

Before spending ANY money on ads:

1. ✅ **Stripe Webhook Configured** - See `SETUP-STRIPE-WEBHOOK.md`
2. ✅ **End-to-End Test Completed** - Make ONE test purchase, verify:
   - Stripe checkout works
   - Webhook fires successfully
   - Email delivers Premium Package
   - Customer experience is flawless
3. ✅ **Conversion Tracking Installed** - See "Conversion Tracking Setup" below

**DO NOT skip these steps.** Running ads without a working funnel = wasting money.

---

## Conversion Math & Budget Planning

### Conservative Scenario (1% conversion rate)
- 1000 clicks × 1% = 10 sales × $49 = **$490 revenue**
- At $1.00 CPC = **$1000 ad spend** = **-$510 loss** ❌
- At $0.50 CPC = **$500 ad spend** = **-$10 loss** ❌

### Optimistic Scenario (2.5% conversion rate - our luxury design target)
- 1000 clicks × 2.5% = 25 sales × $49 = **$1,225 revenue**
- At $1.00 CPC = **$1000 ad spend** = **+$225 profit** ✅
- At $0.50 CPC = **$500 ad spend** = **+$725 profit** ✅

### Realistic Target (1.5-2% conversion rate)
- 500 clicks × 1.75% = 8-9 sales × $49 = **$392-441 revenue**
- At $0.75 CPC = **$375 ad spend** = **+$17-66 profit**

### Budget Recommendation

**Phase 1: Testing (Days 1-3)**
- Budget: **$50-100**
- Goal: Get 50-100 clicks per campaign
- Measure: Actual conversion rate
- Decision: If >1.5%, proceed to Phase 2. If <1.5%, optimize funnel first.

**Phase 2: Scaling (Days 4-10)**
- Budget: **$200-400** (if Phase 1 validates >1.5% conversion)
- Goal: 10-15 sales total
- Strategy: Focus budget on best-performing campaigns

**Total Budget: $250-500** (conservative approach to hit goal)

## Conversion Tracking Setup

### Step 1: Create Google Ads Conversion Action

1. Go to Google Ads → **Tools & Settings** → **Conversions**
2. Click **+ New Conversion Action**
3. Select **Website**
4. Enter conversion details:
   - **Category:** Purchase
   - **Value:** $49 (use the same value for each conversion)
   - **Count:** One (only count unique purchases)
   - **Attribution model:** Last click
5. Click **Create and Continue**
6. **Tag Setup:** Use Google Tag Manager OR install Global Site Tag

### Step 2: Install Conversion Tracking Code

Add this to `/app/success/page.tsx` (the page users see after payment):

```typescript
// Add this useEffect to trigger conversion tracking
useEffect(() => {
  // Google Ads Conversion Tracking
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).gtag) {
    (window as any).gtag('event', 'conversion', {
      'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXX', // Replace with your conversion ID
      'value': 49.0,
      'currency': 'USD',
      'transaction_id': searchParams.get('name') || ''
    });
  }

  // Facebook Pixel (optional, if running Meta ads)
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).fbq) {
    (window as any).fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
      value: 49.0,
      currency: 'USD'
    });
  }
}, [searchParams]);
```

### Step 3: Install Global Site Tag

Add to `/app/layout.tsx` in the `<head>`:

```typescript
<Script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-XXXXXXXXX"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
<Script id="google-ads" strategy="afterInteractive">
  {`
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXX');
  `}
</Script>
```

Replace `AW-XXXXXXXXX` with your Google Ads conversion ID.

### Step 4: Test Conversion Tracking

1. Make a test purchase (use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
2. Complete checkout and land on success page
3. Wait 15-30 minutes
4. Check Google Ads → Conversions dashboard
5. Verify conversion was recorded

**DO NOT run ads without testing conversion tracking first.**

---

## Campaign Settings

### Location Targeting
- **Start with:** United States only
- **Why:** English-speaking, high purchasing power, lower CPC than global
- **Expand later:** Canada, UK, Australia (if performing well)

### Language Targeting
- **English** only

### Networks
- **Search Network:** Yes
- **Display Network:** No (higher quality traffic on search)
- **Search Partners:** Yes (includes Google Shopping, Google Maps)

### Bidding Strategy (for beginners)
- **Start with:** Manual CPC (gives you control)
- **Max CPC:** $1.50-2.00 (adjust based on keyword performance)
- **Switch to:** Target CPA after 30+ conversions (lets Google optimize)

### Ad Rotation
- **Optimize:** Prefer best performing ads

### Ad Schedule
- **Start with:** All days, all hours
- **Optimize later:** Pause low-performing hours (check data after 1 week)

---

## Daily Monitoring Checklist

### First 3 Days (Critical Testing Phase)
Check TWICE daily (morning + evening):

1. **Impressions:** Are ads showing? (If <10/day, increase bids)
2. **Clicks:** Getting clicks? (If <5/day, improve ad copy or increase bids)
3. **CTR:** >2%? (If <1%, ad copy needs work)
4. **CPC:** Within budget? (If >$2, pause expensive keywords)
5. **Conversions:** Any sales? (If 0 after 50 clicks, debug funnel)
6. **Cost per Conversion:** <$100? (If >$150, pause and optimize)

### Days 4-10 (Scaling Phase)
Check ONCE daily:

1. **Identify winners:** Which campaigns/keywords convert best?
2. **Reallocate budget:** Move money from low-performers to winners
3. **Pause losers:** Keywords with >30 clicks + 0 conversions
4. **Add negative keywords:** Irrelevant searches wasting budget
5. **Test ad variations:** A/B test headlines and descriptions

---

## Red Flags (When to STOP and Debug)

🚨 **STOP spending if:**

1. **0 conversions after 100 clicks** → Funnel is broken, not an ads problem
2. **CPC >$3.00** → Keyword too competitive, find alternatives
3. **CTR <0.5%** → Ad copy irrelevant, rewrite
4. **Cost per conversion >$200** → Not profitable, optimize or pause
5. **Quality Score <5** → Landing page relevance issue

**Debugging steps:**
1. Test checkout flow manually (is it working?)
2. Check mobile experience (60%+ traffic is mobile)
3. Review landing page copy (does it match ad promise?)
4. Verify conversion tracking (are conversions being recorded?)
5. Ask 3 friends to try the flow and give honest feedback

---

## Optimization Tips

### Week 1: Testing
- Run all 5 campaigns equally ($10-15/day each)
- Gather data on which keywords convert
- Don't make changes until 50+ clicks per campaign

### Week 2: Scaling (if conversion rate >1.5%)
- **Double budget** on best-performing campaign
- **Cut budget by 50%** on worst-performing campaign
- **Pause keywords** with >30 clicks + 0 conversions
- **Add negative keywords:** "free", "logo", "trademark search" (not buying intent)

### Advanced Tactics (if budget allows)
- **Remarketing:** Show ads to people who visited but didn't buy
- **Competitor targeting:** Bid on "Namecheap alternatives", "GoDaddy name generator"
- **RLSA (Remarketing Lists for Search Ads):** Higher bids for returning visitors

---

## Negative Keywords (Add these immediately)

These searches will WASTE your budget (people not looking to buy):

- `free` (already looking for free tools, won't pay $49)
- `logo` (want logo design, not name generation)
- `trademark` (researching IP, not buying names)
- `domain registration` (want domain only, not brand package)
- `cheap` (price-sensitive, won't pay $49)
- `diy` (want to do it themselves)
- `download` (looking for software, not service)
- `meaning` (researching name meanings, not generating)

**How to add:**
1. Campaign → Keywords → Negative Keywords
2. Add list above
3. Save

---

## Success Metrics to Track

### Primary KPIs
- **Conversion Rate:** Target >1.5% (our luxury design should hit 2-3%)
- **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):** Target <$100 (gives $49 product some margin)
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):** Target >1.0x (break even minimum)

### Secondary KPIs
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Target >2%
- **Quality Score:** Target 7-10
- **Cost Per Click (CPC):** Target <$1.50

### Calculate ROAS
```
ROAS = Revenue ÷ Ad Spend

Example:
10 sales × $49 = $490 revenue
÷ $300 ad spend
= 1.63x ROAS (63% profit margin)
```

## The $500 Path (Realistic Timeline)

**Days 1-2:** Setup & Testing
- Set up Google Ads account
- Create 5 campaigns with ad copy templates above
- Install conversion tracking
- Spend: $20/day = **$40 total**
- Expected: 20-40 clicks, 0-1 sales

**Days 3-5:** Data Collection
- Let campaigns run
- Monitor performance twice daily
- Don't make changes yet (need data)
- Spend: $30/day = **$90 total**
- Expected: 30-60 clicks/day, 1-2 sales

**Days 6-8:** Optimization
- Pause worst-performing campaigns
- Double budget on winners
- Add negative keywords
- Test new ad copy variations
- Spend: $50/day = **$150 total**
- Expected: 50-100 clicks/day, 2-4 sales

**Days 9-10:** Final Push
- Max out budget on proven winners
- Consider raising bids for top keywords
- Run countdown ads ("Limited time!")
- Spend: $60/day = **$120 total**
- Expected: 60-120 clicks/day, 3-5 sales

**Total Spend:** $400
**Total Expected Sales:** 6-12 sales
**Revenue:** $294-588
**Result:** Break even to 47% profit

---

## Alternative: Low-Budget Approach ($100 total)

If $400 feels risky, test with **$100 total:**

**Days 1-3:** Pick ONE best campaign
- Start with "business name generator" (highest volume)
- Spend: $10/day = **$30 total**
- Goal: Validate >1% conversion rate

**Days 4-6:** Scale if working
- If 1+ sales in first 3 days: increase to $20/day
- If 0 sales: pause and debug funnel
- Spend: $20/day = **$60 total**

**Days 7-10:** Final decision
- If profitable: add second campaign
- If break-even: continue cautiously
- If losing money: STOP, fix funnel
- Spend: $10/day (conservative)

**Total Spend:** $100
**Expected:** 2-4 sales = $98-196 revenue
**Risk:** Low (only $100 at risk)

---

## What If Ads Don't Work?

If you spend $100 and get 0-1 sales (conversion <1%), **don't panic**. Try:

### Option 1: Optimize the Funnel
- Ask 5 people to test checkout flow, record their feedback
- A/B test pricing: Try $39 or $59
- Improve landing page copy (more social proof, testimonials)
- Add urgency: "Only 10 packages available this week"
- Add trust signals: "30-day money-back guarantee"

### Option 2: Different Traffic Sources
- **Reddit Ads:** r/Entrepreneur, r/startups (cheaper than Google, $0.10-0.50 CPC)
- **Meta Ads:** Facebook/Instagram (visual, $0.30-1.00 CPC)
- **Organic Social:** Post in entrepreneur communities (free)
- **Product Hunt:** Launch rose.glass (free traffic spike)

### Option 3: Pivot the Offer
- **Lower price tier:** $19 for "Basic Package" (domain report only)
- **Upsell flow:** Generate names free → $9 domain report → $49 full package
- **Subscription model:** $29/month unlimited names + consulting
- **White label:** $499/month for agencies to resell

---
