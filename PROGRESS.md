# rose.glass Progress

## 🎯 THE GOAL: $500 revenue by January 15, 2025

That's ~10 days. Every task should move toward PAYING CUSTOMERS.

**The customer journey:**
```
Google search → Land on SEO page → Generate names FREE → Check domain availability → "Claim this name" bundle ($49)
```

## Meta-Level Thinking (for every agent, every run)

Before picking a task, ask:
1. **Is this the highest-impact thing?** SEO pages bring traffic, but domain availability is the upsell hook.
2. **Am I building toward the journey above?** If not, why?
3. **What would make this FAIL?** (Broken generator? No payment flow? Bad content?)
4. **Should I pivot?** If something feels wrong, document it and suggest alternatives.

### 2026-01-05 - CRITICAL FIX: Generator Now Works in Production ✓
**META-ANALYSIS:**
- Initially planned to build third SEO page (/brand-name-generator)
- BUT realized: ALL existing SEO pages have BROKEN generators → 0% conversion potential
- **Questioning the plan:** Building more SEO pages with broken generators = wasted effort
- **Highest-impact task:** Fix the generator FIRST, then SEO pages become valuable
- **Blocker identified:** Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (not set) instead of OPENROUTER_API_KEY (available with $46 credits)

**Changes made:**
- Switched from @anthropic-ai/sdk to OpenAI SDK + OpenRouter
- Updated /api/generate route to use OpenRouter endpoint (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)
- Uses OPENROUTER_API_KEY (already configured in Vercel environment)
- Removed Anthropic SDK dependency
- Updated .env.example

**IMPACT:**
- ✅ Generator NOW WORKS in production (tested successfully)
- ✅ All SEO pages (/business-name-generator, /startup-name-ideas, /) now functional
- ✅ Customer journey UNBLOCKED: visitors can generate names → path to revenue opened
- 💰 $46 in OpenRouter credits available for name generation

**Test result:**
```
curl -X POST https://rose.glass/api/generate -d '{"description": "task management app"}'
→ Returns 10 creative names successfully (HTTP 200)
```

### 2026-01-05 - Third SEO Page: Brand Name Generator ✓

**META-ANALYSIS - Before Starting:**
- 3 pages live (/, /business-name-generator, /startup-name-ideas)
- Generator working perfectly with OpenRouter
- BUT: Still NO monetization (domain checking, payment flow)
- SEO takes 2-4 weeks to rank → won't hit Jan 15 from organic alone

**Strategic Decision:**
Continue building SEO pages (fast, 30min each) BUT must pivot to monetization soon.
The /brand-name-generator page targets a high-volume keyword and differentiates from
"business name" by focusing on brand identity, memorability, and emotional resonance.

**Multi-Pass Execution:**
1. ✅ Research Pass - Analyzed search intent: brand naming differs from business naming
   - Users care more about memorability, emotional resonance, trademark availability
   - Need to address: types of brand names, validation checklist, common mistakes

2. ✅ Draft Pass - Wrote 2000+ words of original content including:
   - 7 qualities of great brand names (memorable, easy to pronounce, emotionally resonant, etc.)
   - 6 types of brand names with real examples (Apple, Nike, Amazon, Spotify, etc.)
   - 2026 brand naming strategies (authenticity, global-first, voice-search optimization)
   - 10-step validation checklist (trademarks, domains, social handles, pronunciation)
   - Common mistakes to avoid (being generic, ignoring SEO, following fads)
   - 6 comprehensive FAQs

3. ✅ Enrich Pass - Added depth and examples:
   - Real brand examples in each category (descriptive, invented, metaphorical, acronyms, founders, compound)
   - Detailed explanations of why each brand name works
   - Visual hierarchy with color-coded sections and call-out boxes
   - Actionable validation checklist with numbered steps

4. ✅ Polish Pass - SEO optimization:
   - Metadata optimized for "brand name generator" and related keywords
   - Clean layout.tsx with OpenGraph and Twitter card tags
   - Responsive 3-column grid for generated names
   - CTA section encouraging users to scroll back and generate

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `/brand-name-generator/page.tsx` with full generator functionality
- Created `/brand-name-generator/layout.tsx` for SEO metadata (needed for client components)
- Build successful, verified working
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

**IMPACT:**
- ✅ Now have 4 working pages targeting different keywords
- ✅ Each page provides genuine value (not thin content)
- ✅ Keyword coverage: business names, startup names, brand names
- 📈 SEO groundwork laid, but traffic takes time

**CRITICAL NEXT DECISION:**
- Should I build 2-3 more SEO pages? OR
- Should I pivot NOW to monetization (domain checking + payment)?
- **Recommendation:** Build 1-2 more high-value SEO pages (/company-name-generator, /product-name-generator), THEN must pivot to monetization
- **Why:** More pages = better long-term SEO, but without monetization we make $0

### Next Task
**DECISION POINT:** Build 1-2 more SEO pages, then MUST add monetization
1. /company-name-generator (similar to business but more corporate/formal angle)
2. /product-name-generator (specific to product launches, physical/digital products)
3. **THEN PIVOT:** Add domain availability API + payment flow (Stripe) + "Claim this name" upsell

## SEO Pages to Build

Each page should go through multiple passes:
1. **Research** - What do people actually search? What questions do they have?
2. **Draft** - Write initial content (1500+ words)
3. **Enrich** - Add examples, FAQs, comparisons to competitors
4. **Polish** - Improve readability, add internal links, optimize metadata

### Completed
- [x] / - Main landing page with generator
- [x] /business-name-generator - v1 complete (1500+ words, working generator)
- [x] /startup-name-ideas - v1 complete (1800+ words, working generator)
- [x] /brand-name-generator - v1 complete (2000+ words, comprehensive validation checklist)

### Priority Next (Build 1-2 more, then PIVOT to monetization)
- [ ] /company-name-generator - Corporate/formal business naming angle
- [ ] /product-name-generator - Product launch specific naming
- **THEN MONETIZATION PIVOT** (domain API + Stripe + upsell flow)

### Future SEO Pages (lower priority until monetization is live)
- [ ] /app-name-generator
- [ ] /blog-name-generator
- [ ] /podcast-name-generator
- [ ] /youtube-channel-name-generator

## Blockers
- ~~Generator needs API key~~ ✅ FIXED - Now using OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- **Next blocker:** Need to add domain availability checking + payment flow to monetize

## Notes
- ✅ Now using OpenRouter API with $46 in credits available
- Generator works across all pages: /, /business-name-generator, /startup-name-ideas
- Ready to build more SEO pages and focus on monetization
