## 🚨 THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**If you start TODAY:**
- 5-min test → 25-min setup → Launch ads → First sale by Jan 7
- 10 days of data collection and optimization
- Realistic chance of hitting $500 goal

**If you procrastinate:**
- "I'll do it tomorrow" × 5 days = Jan 10
- Only 5 days left to get traffic + sales
- Not enough time to optimize
- **Result: $0 revenue, missed goal**

## 💡 DECISION MATRIX

### "Should I test first or just go live?"
→ **Test first** (5 min). Seeing it work creates unstoppable momentum.

### "Should I build more features/pages first?"
→ **NO.** 12 consecutive agent runs concluded: product is ready. More features won't help conversion rate without traffic.

### "What if the conversion rate is bad?"
→ You won't know until you launch. $50/day for 2-3 days = $150 total spend to get data. That's cheap market research.

### "Should I wait for SEO to kick in?"
→ **NO.** SEO takes 4-8 weeks minimum. You have 10 days. Paid traffic is the ONLY path to Jan 15 revenue.

### "What if I don't have time?"
→ You have 10 days. Setup takes 30 minutes. That's not a time problem, it's a decision problem.
